					I like to think about where the world is going in the future. I’m
					interested in vr and making a product similar to ready player one. I
					can see Facebook doing this and I want to be part of it eventually.
					Personally think it would be a good idea to have a vr world where
					companies make their own worlds where they have games, information,
					and stores. Users then go to worlds and buy things from these stores
					as well as earn more in game currency. Even owning 1% of this currency
					will be immense in the future. Another important thing for vr would be
					to get people to stay active so having a treadmill like hardware is
					very important. The two real competitors are Apple and Google. Apple
					because the way they control app store should be a tell tale sign that
					they can do the same strategy on vr and succeed. Google because they
					have such a large library of data and support.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another thing I think facebook can do and what I’ve been thinking of
					doing myself is music. Make a music app where you can share specific
					song lyrics. Get more data from songs. You can detect someone’s
					personality from their music and you can suggest happy music if you
					think they are sad. You can recommend music with the same type of
					beat. Or even use Facebook’s graph algorithm to recommend music based
					on what their friends like because you are the people you surround
					yourself with. Advertising will be very easy. Taking the Facebook
					approach, you can get artists to recommend music to people based on
					their library of music. For example, a hip hop artist can target their
					recommended music to people who have a lot of hip hop music in their
					library.
