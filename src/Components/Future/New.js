                <li>Virtual reality universe just like "Ready Player One" where everyone meets in the same VR world. You can earn currency by completing tasks and spend currency on in-vr-world content. Content such as clothing, props, vehicles, property, etc. I imagine any company can make their own world and create jobs or sell content within this universe. This virtual world could eventually house almost everything we do. Education can be implemented into virtual reality in many forms. The same thing can be said about entertainment, sports, and fitness.</li>
                <li>Music sharing app which allows you view close friends music and share certain songs. In this app, you are able to share certain aspects of music like a couple lines of lyrics, certain time frames of a song, or and other related data. A good monetization method for this app would be to allow artists to monetize their music in the form of a recommendation. Artists will be able to monetize one of their songs to users who either have similar track names, similar genre, similar artists, etc. Future improvements could be included like giving users a page with all of their favorite artists' info. This can include tours, merch sites, or even video clips.</li>
                <li>Music video production company. I can easily see in the future there will be an hour long tv show featured on netflix which takes certain popular songs, and converts the 3-5 minute story into an hour long story (featuring the song). I can even see this becoming large enough to where most popular artists will start making these hour long features for every album they release. This exclusive content could even be hosted by itself instead of being featured somewhere else.</li>
